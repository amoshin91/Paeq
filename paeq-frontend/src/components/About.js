          <p>
            We've all faced it. You come home from a long day at work, ready to sit back and relax on the couch and tune into some re-runs of Friends. You walk into your apartment in eager anticipation to see Ross complain to Rachel about mundane (yet oddly entertaining) problems. You go to your kitchen to get yourself a nice glass of (insert adult beverage of choice here), only to find a sink full of dirty dishes. You've told you roommates numerous times to just clean them or throw them in the dish-washer. Unfortunately, they think YOU are the dish-washer. You think of the many ways in which you can get away with murder, and how bad can it really be? Isn't there that one area in the mid-west where you can't be prosecuted because of some ancient laws and borders?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            How great would it be if you can solve this issue without having to resort to such drastic measures?
